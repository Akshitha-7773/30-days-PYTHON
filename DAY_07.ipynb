        "At the start of the day you have a checklist The tasks which you were able to finish, should get added to completed_tasks The tasks which you were not able to finish, should get added to incomplete_tasks This project is about organizing your daily tasks into two categories: completed tasks and incomplete tasks. Here’s how it works: 1. At the start of the day, you create a checklist of tasks you want to accomplish. 2. At the end of the day, you review which tasks you could finish and which you couldn’t. – If a task is finished, you move it to the completed tasks list. – If a task is not finished, you move it to the incomplete tasks list. This way, by the end of each day, you’ll have a clear overview of what you completed and what still needs attention.\n"
